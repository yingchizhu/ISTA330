/*
Given an array of integers, input, representing a list encoded, decode the list.
Every pair (2*i, 2*i + 1) of elements in the input, 
means in the decoded list we have as many as input[2*i]'s of the quantity  input[2*i + 1].


Example:
input: [2, 5, 4, 2] (this means in the encoded list we will have two 5's and four 2's )
output: [5, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2]

    let myArray = new Array;
    for(i = 0; i<(input.length-1); i+=2){
        for(j = 0; j<input[i];j++){
            myArray.push(input[i+1])
        }

/*
Given a non-negative integer, we want to reduce it to zero. 
We are allowed to do one of the following three operations:
1. divide the number by 3
2. divide the number by 4
3. subtract 1 from the number
Find the minimum number of operations to reduce a given number to zero.
Example: 
input: 12
output: 3
12 divided by 4 becomes 3 which divided by 3 becomes 1. The third and last step is the substraction by one operation.
